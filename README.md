Can't have many to many for options and time slots, but have some way of copying/pre-filling commonly used ones for UX

Need to be able to add children to a parent by entering SSID and birthday
    - EZ enough, just have a #where query by birthday and SSID that pushes the kid to the parent's children list if one is found
    - kinda a security problem though? SSID and birthday are ez to guess if family friend etc.
